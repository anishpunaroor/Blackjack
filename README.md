# Blackjack

This is a simplified version of Blackjack that I created, and this game can be played on any 
command line tool. Users can place bets on their hands (arbitrary amounts over 100), as well as stand, hit and double down. At the end of the game the user's total winnings are displayed. 

I wanted to learn and become familiar with programming in Go, and this project 
really helped me understand the benefits of Go, such as concurrency with goroutines and functional options. I liked how Go seems to combine various aspects from other languages I am comfortable with, such as pointers and structs from C/C++ along with the readablility and built-in functions of Python.
